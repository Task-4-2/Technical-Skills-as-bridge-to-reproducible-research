Webinar Date/Time 2025-01-17 (10am - 12pm CET) AND 2025-01-31 (9:30am-11:30am CET) Location Big Blue Button Link (January 2025) https://learning.skills4eosc.eu/mod/bigbluebuttonbn/view.php?id=778 Training Description Introduction to supporting reproducible workflows for Data Librarians This is a learning path in three parts, on an introductory level aimed at data librarians and others who are curious about how what reproducibility is and how to implement practices that support reproducibility on a beginner level. The first module introduces the concept od reproducibility and why it is important. The second module is concerned with the reproducbility crisis and actions we can take to improve reproducibility. The third module is devoted to putting theory into practice. It combines lectures on best practices and data hygiene in file organisation with hands-on tutorials using Git, Github and Jupyter Notebooks to improve reproducibility in a collaborative environment. Target audience: Data Librarians and other data curious Beginner level Primary Language: English Access Cost: N Prerequisites No prerequsites Duration 4 hours in total (2 x 2 hours over two days) Training objectives Define reproducibility and replicability in the context of scientific research and explain how they are related and why they matter Explain what reproducible research looks like in practice Explain the barriers to reproducibility and how to overcome them Use basic features of Git repositories and Jupyter notebooks to support reproducible research in your institution.

Learning Unit 1: Reproducibility and Replicability in Scientific Research This unit focuses on reproducibility and replicability in scientific research. It is the first unit in the learning path title \"Technical skills are the bridge to reproducible research: An introduction for data librarians\". In this unit we discuss what reproducibility is, the barriers there are to reproducibility and the benefits of reproducibility. Learning Objectives After completing this unit, you will be able to: - Define reproducibility and replicability in scientific research - Explain how reproducibility and replicability are related but also different - Describe benefits of reproducibiliy to researchers - Describe common barriers to reproducibility Target Audience Data Librarians and other data curious Duration 60 mins Prerequisites None Learning Tools None The content is designed to be taught online, therefore a virtual teaching platform with breakout rooms is used to facilitate the content and activities. Learning Content Topic The content of the unit is described in this document: Unit1_InstructorNotes Related Learning Materials Follow the links to find activities Activities Summary Reproducibility means getting the same results with the same data, while replicability means getting the same results with new data. Reproducibility is the first step toward replicability, and replicating results is how we build scientific knowledge. Reproducibility benefits researchers directly, not just the broader scientific community. It takes time and effort, but that investment pays off in the long run!

Use blank rows to divide between paragraphs. References to external or internal content provided elsewhere should be linked with hyperlinks . Sub-subtitle Refer to a different learning unit using a relative link. For an example, see the Syllabus file. Example italic text Example bold text Lists Example numbered bullets: numbered list one two three Example unnumbered list. unnumbered list item two item three subitem use 4 spaces to create nested subitem You can also create mixed lists: mixed list now numbered subitem subitem number two back to mixed list level 1 bullet Images To add an image, first place the image in the /attachments folder and then use a relative link similar to above using a ! in front. All images should be located in the attachments folder that is on the same level with the content file. Caption: Macaw Parrot Image by Karina Copa from Pixabay Don't forget attribution if the image was not created by you. If you are reusing images or text clear attribution should be provided as in the example above. Same applies in case of reusing text or other type of content. Be careful to follow the attribution rules as provided by the image source (in the example above it is Pixabay). Accessibility Using headings and subheadings, lists and alternative text for images is extremely important so as to ensure accessibility of the content for people with impairments. Also, take care to choose the appropriate color pallette for images. Tables Tables are a bit tricky in md, the easiest way to create them is to use a tool that will generate the md code that you can then just copy paste in your content file. One such tool that can be used is the Markdown Tables Generator available online. The provided example table has been generated using this tool. Column 1 title Column 2 title content 1 content 4 content 2 content 5 content 3 content 6 content 7 Related Learning Materials Refer to exercises, quizzes, games or other types of learning materials where ever they should be included in the unit and provide links to this content. Summary At the end provide a short summary of the main points of the learning unit (these are the key takeaways that help reflect on the learning outcomes) Suggested Reading provide a list of references for further reading that should help clarify the content of the learning unit and elevate the knowledge level Markdown guide , free and open-source reference guide that explains how to use Markdown.","title":"Content of the Learning Path"},{"location":"Learning%20Unit/template_content/#introduction","text":"In this document, you will find a short description of the three units that make up the learning path.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Learning%20Unit/template_content/#learning-unit-1-reproducibility-and-replicability-in-scientific-research","text":"This unit focuses on reproducibility and replicability in scientific research.
