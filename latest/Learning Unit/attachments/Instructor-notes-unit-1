# Learning Unit Template

This session focuses on reproducibility and replicability in scientific research. It is the first unit in the learning path title "Technical skills are the bridge to reproducible research: An introduction for data librarians".
In this session we discuss what reproducibility is, the barriers there are to reproducibility and the benefits of reproducibility.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this unit, you will be able to:
- Define reproducibility and replicability in scientific research
- Explain how reproducibility and replicability are related but also different
- Describe benefits of reproducibiliy to researchers
- Describe common barriers to reproducibility

## Target Audience

- Data Librarians and other data curious

## Duration

- 60 mins

## Prerequisites

- None

## Learning Tools

- None
- The content is designed to be taught online, therefore a virtual teaching platform with breakout rooms is used to facilitate the content and activities.

## Learning Content Topic

The content of the unit is described in this document: [Unit1_InstructorNotes](resources/Learning Unit/attachments/Unit 1 instructor notes DRAFT.docx)

## Summary

Reproducibility means getting the same results with the same data, while replicability means getting the same results with new data. 
Reproducibility is the first step toward replicability, and replicating results is how we build scientific knowledge.
Reproducibility benefits researchers directly, not just the broader scientific community. It takes time and effort, but that investment pays off in the long run!
