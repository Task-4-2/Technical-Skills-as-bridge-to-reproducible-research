## Introduction
In this document, you will find a short description of the three units that make up the learning path.

# Learning Unit 1: Reproducibility and Replicability in Scientific Research

This unit focuses on reproducibility and replicability in scientific research. It is the first unit in the learning path title "Technical skills are the bridge to reproducible research: An introduction for data librarians".
In this unit we discuss what reproducibility is, the barriers there are to reproducibility and the benefits of reproducibility.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this unit, you will be able to:
- Define reproducibility and replicability in scientific research
- Explain how reproducibility and replicability are related but also different
- Describe benefits of reproducibiliy to researchers
- Describe common barriers to reproducibility

## Target Audience

- Data Librarians and other data curious

## Duration

- 60 mins

## Prerequisites

- None

## Learning Tools

- None
- The content is designed to be taught online, therefore a virtual teaching platform with breakout rooms is used to facilitate the content and activities.

## Learning Content Topic

The content of the unit is described in this document: [Unit1_InstructorNotes](https://github.com/Task-4-2/Technical-Skills-as-bridge-to-reproducible-research/blob/59f6fd436090a06e6f0225714777763dece2fb29/resources/Learning%20Unit/attachments/Unit%201%20instructor%20notes%20DRAFT.docx)

## Summary

Reproducibility means getting the same results with the same data, while replicability means getting the same results with new data. 
Reproducibility is the first step toward replicability, and replicating results is how we build scientific knowledge.
Reproducibility benefits researchers directly, not just the broader scientific community. It takes time and effort, but that investment pays off in the long run!

## Learning Objectives

- min one learning objective using the verbs from the Blooms taxonomy

## Target Audience

- who is this learning unit meant for

## Duration

- time needed to learn the provided content

## Prerequisites

- list any knowledge that is required so that the learning unit can be followed

## Learning Tools

- list any tools that are necessary to be used to complete the learning unit
- examples include required software, access to resources, etc.

## Learning Content Topic

Here goes the content of the learning unit divided into a number of subtopics and any additional headings as necessary.

Use blank rows to divide between paragraphs.

References to external or internal content provided elsewhere should be linked with [hyperlinks](https://pages.github.com/).

### Sub-subtitle

Refer to a different learning unit using a relative link. For an example, see the [Syllabus](../index.md) file.

*Example italic text*

**Example bold text**

### Lists

Example numbered bullets:

1. numbered list one
2. two
3. three

Example unnumbered list.

- unnumbered list
- item two
- item three
    - subitem
    - use 4 spaces to create nested subitem

You can also create mixed lists:

- mixed list
    1. now numbered subitem
    2. subitem number two
- back to mixed list level 1 bullet

### Images

To add an image, first place the image in the /attachments folder and then use a relative link similar to above using a ! in front. 
All images should be located in the attachments folder that is on the same level with the content file.

Don't forget attribution if the image was not created by you. If you are reusing images or text clear attribution should be provided as in the example above. Same applies in case of reusing text or other type of content. Be careful to follow the attribution rules as provided by the image source (in the example above it is Pixabay).

### Accessibility

Using headings and subheadings, lists and alternative text for images is extremely important so as to ensure accessibility of the content for people with impairments. Also, take care to choose the appropriate color pallette for images.

### Tables

Tables are a bit tricky in md, the easiest way to create them is to use a tool that will generate the md code that you can then just copy paste in your content file.
One such tool that can be used is the [Markdown Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) available online. The provided example table has been generated using this tool. 

| **Column 1 title** | **Column 2 title**  |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| content 1          |      content 4      |
| content 2          |      content 5      |
| content 3          | content 6 content 7 |

### Related Learning Materials

Refer to exercises, quizzes, games or other types of learning materials where ever they should be included in the unit and provide links to this content.


## Summary

At the end provide a short summary of the main points of the learning unit (these are the key takeaways that help reflect on the learning outcomes)

## Suggested Reading

- provide a list of references for further reading that should help clarify the content of the learning unit and elevate the knowledge level
