# Introduction
In this document, you will find a short description of the three units that make up the learning path.

## Target Audience
- Data Librarians and other data curious

# Learning Unit 1: Reproducibility and Replicability in Scientific Research

This unit focuses on reproducibility and replicability in scientific research. It is the first unit in the learning path title "Technical skills are the bridge to reproducible research: An introduction for data librarians".
In this unit we discuss what reproducibility is, the barriers there are to reproducibility and the benefits of reproducibility.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you will be able to:
·	Define reproducibility and replicability in scientific research
·	Explain how reproducibility and replicability are related but also different
·	Describe benefits of reproducibiliy to researchers
·	Describe common barriers to reproducibility

## Duration
- 60 mins

## Prerequisites
- None

## Learning Tools
- None
- The content is designed to be taught online, therefore a virtual teaching platform with breakout rooms is used to facilitate the content and activities.

## Learning Content Topic
The unit discusses the difference between an original research study and a replication study. Both play an important role in the scientific process. But how do we go from science to knowledge? Or from a single scientific result to reliable knowledge and understanding of some phenomenon or topic? 
Step one in the scientific method is to formulate a research question or hypothesis. 
Step two is to design a research study to answer that question or test that hypothesis, using appropriate research methods. For instance, we may want to conduct an experiment, which means manipulating an independent variable and measuring a dependent variable to determine cause-and-effect. Once we decide on the appropriate study design, step three is data collection and step four is data analysis. 
In step five, after we analyze all the data, we get our results – we get the answer to our research question or the test of our hypothesis.

However, one research study and one result can be very exciting and can give us a hint of how something works, but it is not reliable enough. We could get lucky and get a great result purely by chance. Or the phenomenon we study could be very complex and the data could be messy. There are lots of reasons why a single research result is only the start of the scientific investigation, not the end of it.  

This unit introduces the learner to what reproducibility is and how it benefits science. In conclusion, the unit addresses the barriers to reproducibility, which are described as:

 1. Cultural Barriers:
·	Researchers are rewarded for producing high-impact, novel results, not for making their work reproducible.
·	The ‘publish or perish’ culture pressures them to prioritize speed over careful validation.
·	Success is often measured by quantity and impact, not quality or reproducibility.
2. Publishing Barriers:
·	Journals favor new findings over replication studies.
·	Many journals don’t require authors to share data, code, or methods, and peer reviewers don’t often have the time or expertise to verify reproducibility.
3. Technical Barriers:
·	(Lack of Standardization) Different fields often use their own methods, tools, and protocols, which makes it harder to reproduce work across studies. 
·	(Data and Software Availability) Outdated or unavailable software can make it impossible to reproduce results.
·	(Lack of Infrastructure) Some fields don’t have reliable platforms to store and share large datasets, and reproducing complex simulations can require resources that not everyone has. 
·	(Collaboration and Data Integration Challenges) Interdisciplinary work can face unique problems, like differences in data formats, methods, or terminology. Large datasets also come with logistical and technical challenges.


The content of the unit is described in more detail in this document where each slide used in the training is enriched with speaker notes: [Unit1_InstructorNotes](https://github.com/Task-4-2/Technical-Skills-as-bridge-to-reproducible-research/blob/59f6fd436090a06e6f0225714777763dece2fb29/resources/Learning%20Unit/attachments/Unit%201%20instructor%20notes%20DRAFT.docx)

## Summary
Reproducibility means getting the same results with the same data, while replicability means getting the same results with new data. 
Reproducibility is the first step toward replicability, and replicating results is how we build scientific knowledge.
Reproducibility benefits researchers directly, not just the broader scientific community. It takes time and effort, but that investment pays off in the long run!

# Learning Unit 2: Reproducibility Crisis and Remedies

## Learning Objectives

·	Explain what reproducible research looks like in practice
·	Explain the barriers to reproducibility and how to overcome them


## Duration

- 60 mins

## Prerequisites
- Please read the two cases (Activity 3 and 3a), which can be downloaded here: [Activities](https://github.com/Task-4-2/Technical-Skills-as-bridge-to-reproducible-research/tree/main/resources/Learning%20Unit/Activities)

## Learning Tools
- None

## Learning Content Topic
This unit introduces the Reproducibility Crisis, what it is and actions that can be taken to implement reproducible workflows to counter this crisis.

### What is the Reproducibility Crisis?
Nature did a rather extensive survey a few years ago on reproducibility. It showed that 90 % of the survey participants – the researchers - thinks that a reproducibility crisis is a fact - either slightly or significantly (1,576 scientist in sample).
- More than 70 % of researchers have failed to reproduce another scientist’s experiments. More than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. Publishing replicated positive studies did not feel very motivating (24 %) and journals are reluctant towards publishing negative replication results (13 %)
- More than 60 % experienced failure in reproducibility due to pressure to publish and selective reporting. Adding to the difficulties to comply to reproducibility practices were also competition for grants and growing amount of bureaucracy demands
- Almost 90 % felt that a more robust experimental design and improved statistics and mentorship could help to solve the reproducibility crisis. Also enhanced practices and journal checklists were ranked high
- 80 % thinks that research funders and publishers should do much more to address this issue
One analysis estimates that 85% of biomedical research efforts are wasted

**Example bold text**

### Lists

Example numbered bullets:

1. numbered list one
2. two
3. three

Example unnumbered list.

- unnumbered list
- item two
- item three
    - subitem
    - use 4 spaces to create nested subitem

You can also create mixed lists:

- mixed list
    1. now numbered subitem
    2. subitem number two
- back to mixed list level 1 bullet

### Images

To add an image, first place the image in the /attachments folder and then use a relative link similar to above using a ! in front. 
All images should be located in the attachments folder that is on the same level with the content file.

Caption: Macaw Parrot

Don't forget attribution if the image was not created by you. If you are reusing images or text clear attribution should be provided as in the example above. Same applies in case of reusing text or other type of content. Be careful to follow the attribution rules as provided by the image source (in the example above it is Pixabay).

### Accessibility

Using headings and subheadings, lists and alternative text for images is extremely important so as to ensure accessibility of the content for people with impairments. Also, take care to choose the appropriate color pallette for images.

### Tables

Tables are a bit tricky in md, the easiest way to create them is to use a tool that will generate the md code that you can then just copy paste in your content file.
One such tool that can be used is the [Markdown Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) available online. The provided example table has been generated using this tool. 

| **Column 1 title** | **Column 2 title**  |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| content 1          |      content 4      |
| content 2          |      content 5      |
| content 3          | content 6 content 7 |
