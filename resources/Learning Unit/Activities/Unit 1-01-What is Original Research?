# What is original research?


This is a short activity at the start of the training to warm the learners up and to get the discussions between learners going. From their own perspectives the learners discuss what they consider to be an original research study.

## Activity duration

Depends on the number of participants. As a rule of thumb, allow a minimum of 10 minutes discussion and 3 minutes per group to present thier answers.

## Number of people that it can be performed with

from 2 - 30

## Goal of activity

The goal of this activity is twofold. First: to let the learners think carefully about the definitions and processes we will discuss, 
and try to come up with their own definitions, in their own words, so the terms make sense. And second: to give the instructor a sense
of where the learners are in their knowledge and understanding of the topic. Do they know the definitions and have first-hand experience
applying them? Do they know the definitions but the knowledge is more abstract and not tied to real-life experience of conducting research? 
Maybe there are some learners coming from other scientific disciplines and using a different method? (Learners discuss in small groups,
then the instructor brings the whole class together to discuss.)

## Materials
- If the course is online, create group rooms
- If analog teaching, pens and paper
- Collaborative note document

## Instructions

Learners discuss in groups what is an original research study from their own perspective and/or discipline? Questions they need to address are:
What is a replication study? 
How do they differ?

## Tips and Tricks
- if the activity is run online, consider making break-out groups for group discussions. 
- for both online and physical courses, it is a good idea to ask each group to select one person who will share the groups' reflections
