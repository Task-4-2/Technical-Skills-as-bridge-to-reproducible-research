# Activity name

What is original research?

Summary description of the activity.

## Activity duration

Depends on the number of participants. As a rule of thumb, allow a minimum of 10 minutes discussion and 3 minutes per group to present thier answers.

## Number of people that it can be performed with

from 2 - 30

## Goal of activity

The goal of this activity is twofold. First: to let the learners think carefully about the definitions and processes we will discuss, 
and try to come up with their own definitions, in their own words, so the terms make sense. And second: to give the instructor a sense
of where the learners are in their knowledge and understanding of the topic. Do they know the definitions and have first-hand experience
applying them? Do they know the definitions but the knowledge is more abstract and not tied to real-life experience of conducting research? 
Maybe there are some learners coming from other scientific disciplines and using a different method? (Learners discuss in small groups,
then the instructor brings the whole class together to discuss.)

## Materials
