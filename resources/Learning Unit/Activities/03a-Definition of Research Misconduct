# Misconduct
This activity builds on the two cases:
1. The case of Brian Wansink - P Hacking [Wansink case](resources/Learning Unit/Activities/03b-The case of Brian Wansink - P Hacking.pdf)
2. RGC - 5 is not rat retinal ganglion, available to read her: [RGC-5 is not rat retinal ganglion](https://iclac.org/education/rgc-5/)

The learners are asked to read these two documents before the course, with the perspective:
What is P-Hacking?
Why does this practice contribute to the reproducibility crisis?
How can this be avoided?

First, the trainer presents what research misconduct is (Unit 2, slides 33 - 37), defining the concepts of Fabrication, Falsicfication and Plagiarism:
Research misconduct posess significant challenges to the integrity and reliability of scientific work. It includes a range of unethical behaviors that undermine the credibility of research outcomes and the trust placed in the scientific community. 

#Fabrication: 
This involves making up data or results that never existed. Researchers may invent entire experiments, observations, or outcomes to support their hypotheses or claims. Fabrication can lead to the dissemination of false information and misguided scientific understanding.
An example of Data Fabrication:
Example: A researcher conducting a clinical trial fabricates patient data to show positive treatment outcomes when, in reality, the trial did not yield such results.

#Falsification: 
Falsification is the manipulation or alteration of data or results to fit a particular narrative or desired outcome. This can involve selectively excluding or modifying data points, graphs, or statistical analyses. Falsification distorts the true representation of research findings.
An example of Results Falsification:
Example: A scientist alters laboratory results to make experimental observations more consistent with their hypothesis, misleading readers and the scientific community.

#Plagiarism:
An example of plagiarism: An author submits a research paper containing sections copied verbatim from another researcher's work without proper citation or attribution.

#Optional
The trainer can supplement with examples of the following, dependent on the learner group:
Image Manipulation:
Example: Altering images or graphs to enhance or distort experimental results, misleading readers about the actual data collected.

Ghost Authorship:
Example: Including individuals as authors who did not contribute significantly to the research, often to boost the perceived credibility of the work.

Redundant Publication:
Example: Publishing the same study or data in multiple journals without proper disclosure, creating a false impression of independent findings.

Salami Slicing:
Example: Dividing a comprehensive study into several smaller publications to artificially inflate the number of publications, compromising the scientific value of each piece.

Selective Reporting:
Example: Presenting only data that supports a particular hypothesis while omitting conflicting or unfavorable results, skewing the overall interpretation of the research.

Citation Manipulation:
Example: Forcing citations to one's own work or colluding with other researchers to artificially inflate the perceived impact of certain publications.

Reviewer Misconduct:
Example: A peer reviewer, instead of providing constructive feedback, uses their position to advance personal interests, discredit competitors, or unjustly promote certain research.
These examples highlight the diverse ways in which research misconduct can occur, emphasizing the importance of vigilance, ethical oversight, and a commitment to upholding the highest standards of integrity within the scientific community. 
Addressing these issues requires collective efforts from researchers, institutions, and the broader scientific community to maintain the credibility and trustworthiness of scientific research.

## Instructions

After the small group discussion. The trainer can ask the students these three questions 
What did they understand about p-hacking? 
Why does this practice contribute to the reproducibility crisis?

Based on the responses, the trainer can give a few elements of reponses to the group:

Increased false positives: P-hacking inflates the likelihood of false positives, making research findings less reliable and harder to reproduce.
Non-generalizable results: P-hacked results often depend on specific conditions of the original study, failing to replicate in different contexts or samples.
Biased scientific literature: By promoting the publication of positive results, p-hacking skews the literature, creating a misleading impression of strong evidence in certain fields.
Erosion of trust and slowed progress: The discovery of irreproducible findings erodes trust in science and diverts resources, slowing down genuine scientific advancement.

How can this be avoided ? 
Based on the responses the trainer can give a few elements of reponses to the group :

Pre-register studies: Define hypotheses and analysis plans in advance to prevent data manipulation.
Use larger sample sizes: This reduces the likelihood of false positives and increases the robustness of results.
Report all analyses: Share all data and analysis attempts, not just significant outcomes, to ensure transparency.
Encourage replication: Promote the replication of studies to confirm findings and validate results.


## Tips and Tricks
- Send out a reminder before the training to the learners and encourage them to read the cases
