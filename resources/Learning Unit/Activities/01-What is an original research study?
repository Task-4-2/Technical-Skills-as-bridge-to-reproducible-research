# Activity name
What is an original research study?


Once you are with your group, here are three questions that we would like you to discuss. 
1.	In your own words, what is an original research study?
2.	What is a replication study?
3.	How do they differ?
Please add your thoughts to the shared document. The link is in the chat. 



## Activity duration
-10 mins

## Number of people that it can be performed with
Two or more

## Goal of activity
-The goal of this activity is twofold. First: to let the learners think carefully about the definitions and processes we will discuss, and try to come up with their own definitions, in their own words, so the terms make sense. And second: to give the instructor a sense of where the learners are in their knowledge and understanding of the topic. Do they know the definitions and have first-hand experience applying them? Do they know the definitions but the knowledge is more abstract and not tied to real-life experience of conducting research? Maybe there are some learners coming from other scientific disciplines and using a different method?

## Instructions

Divide learners into groups and send you into breakout rooms.

Provide a collaborative document to record observations and discussion notes.

Encourage the learners to choose a representative to speak on behalf of the group when gathering up in the main group.


## Tips and Tricks
- In the first step, learners discuss in small groups and record their ideas in a shared document. Alternatively, each learner could reflect on their own and add ideas to the chat. In the second step, the instructor brings the whole class together to discuss.
