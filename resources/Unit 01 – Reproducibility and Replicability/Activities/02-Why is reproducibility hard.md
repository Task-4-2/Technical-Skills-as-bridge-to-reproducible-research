# Why is reproducibility hard?

This is a discussion activity, where in groups the participants discuss the following:
In your experience or in your scientific field: 
1.	Why is reproducibility hard? 
2.	What are some barriers and challenges?


## Activity duration
10 mins

## Number of people that it can be performed with
More than 2

## Goal of activity
To encourage participants to think about the barriers they see to reproducibility from the perspective of the discipline they work in, or in the case
of librarians, the users they support. This discussion will hopefully help them think critically and ask questions about the remainder of the unit.

## Materials
- virtual teaching platform and breakout rooms

## Instructions

- The trainer is recommended to go through the questions in the main groups before sending learners out into break-out rooms

## Tips and Tricks
- Refer back to the learners' observations and thoughts from the discussion in the slides that follow about what deters reproduciblity.
